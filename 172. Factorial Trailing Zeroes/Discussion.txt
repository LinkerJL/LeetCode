trailing zeroes can only be generated by the product of 2 and 5.
so how many trailing zeroes <==> how many 2*5

in range of [1, n], the number of 2 is less than that of 5.
so <==> how many 5

consider n = 25, there are 25 /5 + 25 /5 /5 = 6 5s.
consider n = 125, there are 125 /5 + 125 /5 /5 + 125 /5 /5 /5 = 31 5s.
so the algorithm is
n /5 + n /5 /5 + n /5 /5 /5 + ...
