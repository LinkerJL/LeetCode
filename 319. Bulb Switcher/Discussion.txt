Find the pattern:

n		result
0		0
1		1
2		1
3		1
4		2
5		2
6		2
7		2
8		2
9		3
10		3
11		3
12		3
13		3
14		3
15		3
16		4

so result is floor(n^(1/2)).

A bulb will be toggled only during the round of its factors. 
e.g. 6th bulb will be toggled at 1,2,3,6.
The final state of a bulb only depends on if the number of its factor is odd or even.
If odd, the bulb is on, otherwise it's off.

The number of one number's factor is odd if and only if it is a perfect square.
(take 18 and 16 as an example: 18 has factor pairs of [1,18],[2,9],[3,6]
while 16 has factor pairs of [1,16],[2,8],[4], as you can see, perfect squares will
always have a factor pair that contains only one number)

So we only need to find out how many perfect squares are smaller than n.
