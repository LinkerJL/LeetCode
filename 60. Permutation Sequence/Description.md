Permutation Sequence
====================

>The set **[1,2,3,...,n]** contains a total of _n!_ unique permutations.

>By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,

>We get the following sequence (ie, for _n = 3_):

>1. **"123"**
>2. **"132"**
>3. **"213"**
>4. **"231"**
>5. **"312"**
>6. **"321"**

>Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

>**Note**: Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
